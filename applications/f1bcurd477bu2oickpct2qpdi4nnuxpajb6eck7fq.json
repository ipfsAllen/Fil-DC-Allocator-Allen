    "Brief history of your project and organization": "A research institute funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, focusing on brain science and biomedical research. They have released several widely used datasets, especially in the fields of neuroscience and biomedicine.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "High-resolution atlas data of mouse, human and primate brains;\nResearch resources in the field of cell biology;\nOften used to train/test neural network models or build brain-computer interfaces",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "1. Source Identification and Download\n\t•\tData will be obtained directly from official Allen Institute sources\n\t•\tDownload scripts are written in Python using requests, wget, or Allen’s API endpoints.\n2. File Validation & Hashing\n\t•\tEach downloaded file will be checked for integrity using SHA256 checksums.\n\t•\tA manifest file (CSV) is created, listing all filenames, source URLs, file types, sizes, and hashes.\n\t•\tThis provides a transparent provenance trail and enables third-party auditing.\n3. Data Structuring & Reformatting (If Needed)\n\t•\tAll files are reviewed for naming consistency and reorganized into clearly labeled folders by data type and subject \n4. Data Packaging for Filecoin\n\t•\tFiles are batched into CAR files (Content Addressable Archives) using tools like:\n\t•\tlotus or\n\t•\tboost for automatic CAR generation.\n\t•\tTypical CAR file size: ~32GiB for sealing efficiency.\n\t•\tFor each CAR, the following metadata is retained:\n\t•\tOriginal filenames\n\t•\tCID\n\t•\tOriginal download source\n\t•\tSHA256 hash",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "•\thttps://portal.brain-map.org/\n\t•\thttps://mouse.brain-map.org/\n\t•\thttps://celltypes.brain-map.org/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "Less than 1 year",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, North America, Asia other than Greater China, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Lotus built-in data transfer",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03315260 DE\nf03289271 DE \nf03542777 VN\nf03367915 US\nf03099666 HK\nf03099667 HK\nf03607310 Brazil",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
