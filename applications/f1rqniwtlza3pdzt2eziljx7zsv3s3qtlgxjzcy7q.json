    "Brief history of your project and organization": "GeoNet provides geological hazard information for Aotearoa New Zealand. This dataset contains data and products recorded by the GeoNet sensor network.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data include raw data in proprietary and Receiver Independent Exchange Format (RINEX) and local tie-in survey conducted during equipment changes, more details can be found on the GeoNet geodetic page website.\nCoastal gauge data include relative measurement of sea level measured by tsunami monitoring gauges. Raw and quality control data are provided in CREX format (Character Form for the Representtion and eXchange of metereological data), more details can be found on the GeoNet coastal tsunami monitoring gauges page.\nCamera images data include webcam images from the GeoNet Volcano monitoring network and Built Environment Instrumentation Programme, more details can be found on the GeoNet camera page.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "First, I downloaded the dataset from aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://geonet-open-data/ and categorized it by collection. I then created different directories to categorize the files and packaged them into car files ranging in size from 20GB to 32GB. I then distributed them to the SP via HTTP for storage.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "Total: 371.8854 TiB\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://geonet-open-data/camera \naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://geonet-open-data/coastal\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://geonet-open-data/gnss\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://geonet-open-data/seismic-products\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://geonet-open-data/time-series\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://geonet-open-data/waveforms",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China, North America, South America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03289271 Germany\nf03315260 Germany\nf03367915 United States\nf03542777 Vietnam\nf03603117 United States\nf03559187 United States\nf03100006 HongKong\nf03100007 HongKong",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
